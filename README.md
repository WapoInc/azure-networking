# About this repo: The art of the possible and the *why* behind the various design options

The purpose of this repo is to deliver **layered, reusable and github friendly** network architecture diagrams for Cloud Solutions Architects to run effective Azure design and skilling sessions. The repository will include tips and tools for effective story telling that explain the **why behind the design options based on requirements** and the art of the possible.  The design areas include - Azure Networking, Hybrid connectivity architectures, routing, firewalling, load balancing, multi-region, secure design, cross functional networking areas and AKS networking. The content is based on **real customer and partner design sessions** with collaboration from cross-functional architects.  The networking complexity is broken down into **layers** with **one diagram** per design area using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) now [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/). This repo will include configuration snippets to reduce the lab prep time and the need to leave the labs running for demos.

4. View Outline: View -> Outline
5. Flow animation: Select Flow -> Flow animation
6. [Sketch Style](https://www.diagrams.net/blog/rough-style) (hand drawn style)
7. [Whiteboard](https://www.diagrams.net/blog/change-editor-mode):  Extras-> Theme-> Sketch
8. [Curved lines](https://drawio-app.com/curved-connectors-in-draw-io-diagrams/) for flows
9. [vscode integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)
10. [Group shapes](https://drawio-app.com/more-draw-io-shortcuts-to-streamline-your-diagramming/) using CTRL-G

## Installation

There are three options to open the draw.io diagrams.

1. Use the desktop app
    Download the desktop app from the microsoft store. 
    ![desktop-app](extras/drawio-app.png)

    Dowload drawio file from github and open in the desktop app. File -> Raw -> Save link as.
    ![save-drawio](extras/save-drawio.png)
    
2. Use the web browser to open the file online using the link [here](https://app.diagrams.net/)

3. Integrate with vscode using the ![vscode extension](extras/vscode-extension.png)
